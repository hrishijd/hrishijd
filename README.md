## Hi there 👋,
I'm Hrishi Jadhav, I'm a full stack developer and a self-motivated Engineer with 2 years of experience, who wants to solve problems with code and find logical solutions to create an impact. 
I believe programming languages, libraries, protocols etc are tools to solve problems, and one should be capable of learning and working with tools he hasn't used, and adapt with this constantly evolving tech industry.

- JPA/Hibernate
- SQL
